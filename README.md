# Forum Horizons' website

Website for the association Forum Horizons that aims to create a forum for students in engineering schools. The goal of this forum is to present to students compagnies that are aware of their effect on the planet.

The whole website is developped in Node.JS. I know that this technology is not the best in terms of ecology and things - especially due to the famous node_modules folder -, but the same in .NET is way more complicated.

The website is hosted by myself on a Raspberry Pi 1 using Apache2 on Raspbian Lite.

I'm using express.JS as a backend framework and materialize for the front.

Setup : node start
